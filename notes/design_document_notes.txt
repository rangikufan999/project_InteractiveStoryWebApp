Project Overview
	-This project is intended to serve as way to create, share, play, and enjoy interactive stories. In its prototype phase, the project should be able to allow a user to create a story with a built in editor, play that said story, and save the story both with localStorage and through a download saveFile feature (The Download feature being incredibly difficult to implement.)


Tasks to Accomplish
	-Build the Site Layout
		This consists of building all relevant pages that the site will require:
			1.) Main Landing Page
			2.) Create Story Page
				-This is where the editor will reside.
			3.) Search Stories Page
				-This is where a user will be able to search for stories in a database (Future Feature)
			4.) Play Stories Page
				-This is the meat where everything happens, you play interactive stories on this page.
			5.) Sign Up Page (FF)
				-Once the client side has been established the sign up page will be where users can create an account.
			6.) Login Page (FF)
				-When a user with an account wishes to login they will be directed to here, or this could be a widget where users can enter their info upon clicking the login button to open said widget up.
			7.) Contact Page and Social Media (FF)
				-This is not an immediately needed page but one that might be needed if the project gains traction and is put here for complete reference.
	-Build the Editor
		The editor is something of an enigma. Until this one can be solved stories will just manually be drafted into the site. 

		The general premise is that the editor will allow one to manipulate a gui to auto generate the story into a working interactive and playable story to run in the play component.
		
	-Build the Story Play Component
		The page where stories are built has the interactie story play component. Which requires the following things be accomplished: 
			1.) Main Action Window
				-This is where backgrounds and actors (may not be needed if going completely text based but background will still be needed)
			2.) Dialogue Window
				-Where all text pertaining to the story will be displayed at.
				-Should be styled in a way that makes different types of text distinguishable for better readability. For example, Inner Monologue could have a red or green text color while Speech could have an amber color with quotes wrapping around it.
				-Navigation buttons or dialogue history window for remembering what was said.
				-Save Story Button for saving locatin in story
			3.) Action Window
				-This window has applicable buttons placed here according to what might be doable in a certain situation. This is the most complex part because interactive stories can provide an almost never ending supply of actions that might be carried out.
	-Build the Search Story Structure
		This will happen when enough stories have been created and added to the database which will initially be story files owned by the server but will shift over to a database when easily manageable to do. (AKA I need to learn that stuff).

		Main pont of this component is to allow search of stories based on a tag system. (Much like those used on booru image sites to organize images into easiyly searchable categories.)

			1.) Implement Tag System to search for stories
			2.) Connect stories to client side first.
			3.) Create structure for implementation of Database system
			4.) Test and connect client systems on Database and server.

	-Build Login/Signup/User system
		This system will come when most of the basic functionality of the site is complete including the editor.

			1.) Establishing a signup component to properly make new accounts.
			2.) Make signup secure using encryption.
			3.) Work on login component and making sure authentication works and is secure.
			4.) Make sure logout works and is secure
			5.) Make sure that functionality of site works the individual user once logged in.
			6.) Clean Up Bugs
